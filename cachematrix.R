makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

# makeCacheMatrix is a new function that give back a list of functions
# one of the objetives is to store a martix and cached value of the inverse of the 
# matrix.
# This functions also contains the following functions:
#getMatrix      get the value of a matrix 
#setMatrix      set the value of a matrix
#cacheInverse   get the cahced value (inverse of the matrix)
#getInverse     get the cahced value (inverse of the matrix


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
# holds the cached value or could give NULL if nothing is cached
# initially nothing is cached so set it to NULL
